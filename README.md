This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

# Project Ideas for SMART on FHIR Development

Here are some ideas to help you explore and develop applications using FHIR resources:

## 1. Patient Lookup App
**Description:**  
Create an app that allows users to search for patient details such as demographics using attributes like ID, name, or other criteria.

**Key FHIR Concepts:**
- **Patient Resource:** Understand how to query, read, and update patient information.
- **FHIR Search:** Learn how to use the GET method to search for patient data based on parameters like name, identifier, or birthdate.
- **FHIR Endpoints:** Explore how FHIR APIs expose RESTful endpoints for resource access.

**Documentation:**
- [Patient Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html)
- [FHIR Search](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html)
- [FHIR REST API](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html)

## 2. Appointment Scheduling App
**Description:**  
Build an app that allows patients to schedule, update, or cancel appointments with healthcare providers.

**Key FHIR Concepts:**
- **Appointment Resource:** Learn how to handle appointment data.
- **Patient and Practitioner Resources:** Link appointments with patients and healthcare providers.
- **Search and Operations:** Use search to find available time slots and POST operations to create appointments.

**Documentation:**
- [Appointment Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/appointment.html)
- [Practitioner Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/practitioner.html)
- [FHIR Scheduling](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/scheduling.html)

## 3. Medication Management App
**Description:**  
Develop an app for clinicians or patients to view and manage prescribed medications.

**Key FHIR Concepts:**
- **MedicationRequest Resource:** Understand how to create, read, and update medication requests.
- **Medication Resource:** Learn how medications are represented in FHIR.
- **Patient Resource:** Link medications to patients for a full health record view.

**Documentation:**
- [MedicationRequest Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationrequest.html)
- [Medication Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medication.html)
- [FHIR Workflow](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html)

## 4. Allergy Checker App
**Description:**  
Create an app that allows healthcare providers to input patient allergies and check for interactions with prescribed medications.

**Key FHIR Concepts:**
- **AllergyIntolerance Resource:** Learn to track and manage patient allergies.
- **MedicationRequest Resource:** Check medications for potential interactions.
- **FHIR Terminology:** Explore coding systems like SNOMED CT and RxNorm for standardizing allergy and medication data.

**Documentation:**
- [AllergyIntolerance Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/allergyintolerance.html)
- [FHIR Terminology](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies.html)

## 5. Clinical Observation Tracker
**Description:**  
Build an app that tracks key clinical observations such as vitals (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, temperature).

**Key FHIR Concepts:**
- **Observation Resource:** Learn to create, read, and update clinical observations.
- **FHIR Search:** Enable searches based on observation type and patient ID.

**Documentation:**
- [Observation Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html)
- [FHIR Search](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html)

## 6. Immunization Record App
**Description:**  
Create an app for healthcare providers or patients to manage and view immunization records.

**Key FHIR Concepts:**
- **Immunization Resource:** Understand how to represent immunization events.
- **Patient Resource:** Link immunization records to specific patients.

**Documentation:**
- [Immunization Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/immunization.html)
- [Patient Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html)

---

## 7. Personal Health Record Viewer
**Description:**  
Build an app that allows patients to view their entire health record, including conditions, medications, allergies, and test results.

**Key FHIR Concepts:**
- **Patient Resource:** Retrieve patient information for the health record.
- **Condition, MedicationRequest, Observation, and AllergyIntolerance Resources:** Fetch related health data for the patient.
- **FHIR Bundle:** Learn to group multiple resources into a single bundle for display.

**Documentation:**
- [FHIR Bundle](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html)
- [Condition Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/condition.html)
- [Observation Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html)
